  <h3 class="lh-title f-4 tc">No Build System or Pre-Processing</h3>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span> can be deployed as a single <code>.css</code> file that is under 200K (25K compressed).  It doesn't use any pre-processing and doesn't require any build steps in your app. Installing it does not require <strong>any</strong> dependencies at runtime <strong>or</strong> development time.
  </p>
  <h3 class="lh-title f-4 tc">Behavior-Revealing Design</h3>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    HTML that uses <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span> results in HTML whose presentation you can easily and correctly predict, just by looking at the HTML.  No more chasing down tons of files and classes just to try to figure out what the browser is going to do when the page is rendered.
  </p>
  <h3 class="lh-title f-4 tc">Grid-based Design System</h3>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    For 90% of the use cases of 90% of apps, you don't need infinite margins, paddings, widths, or font sizes.  A few distinct sizes will cover you. <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span> provides a modular scale that means all your elements will have visual rhythm, and provide you enough flexibilty for most situations. Quickly audit every single size to find the right one.
  </p>
  <h3 class="lh-title f-4 tc">Terse but Intuitive Class Names</h3>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    You know CSS, so when you learn that <code>fw-3</code> sets <code>font-weight</code> to <code>300</code>, you'll have a good guess as to what <code>fw-6</code> and <code>fw-bold</code> do.  This means fast designing in the browser without the need for autocomplete and fewer trips to the documentation.
  </p>
  <h3 class="lh-title f-4 tc">Mobile-First Design <span class="db">with Common Breakpoints</span></h3>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    Each class <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span> provides includes variants for non-small screens, medium screens, and large screens. You can use these to create a responsive design without writing any CSS or media queries.
  </p>
  <h3 class="lh-title f-4 tc">Gradual Customization</h3>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span> ships as a single <code>.css</code> file, but you can install a version with only CSS classes and provide your own values for the grid-based design system's variables (using the defaults as a starting point).  Customize fonts, modular scales, and colors using only CSS—on build or compilation step for most cases.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy mh-auto">
    <strong>However</strong>, if you have more needs, <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span> does provide tooling at <em>development</em> time to allow you to add your own classes that conform to <span class="fv-sc tracked">MelangeCSS</span>'s naming convention, or even create your own nuance design system.  If you need it.
